        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>Welcome to tic tac slot! It pretty much plays like tic tac toe with a few key differances</p>
        <li>click the red lever to start with X going first or the blue lever to start with O</li>
        <li>On your turn you need to stop the reel on your symbol or a double symbol</li>
        <li>The game ends when the all reels have been stopped</li>
        <li>Reels you score are only counted towards your point total if the rest of the line is either your symbol or doubles</li>
        <li>Like in Tic Tac Toe lines can be scored horizontaly, verticaly, or diagonaly</li>
        <li>Each symbol you get is 100 points and each double in a line doubles the total points in a line</li>
        <li>Lines that are all doubles go to no one</li>
